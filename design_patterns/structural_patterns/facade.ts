üß† What Is the Facade Pattern?

The Facade Pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

Think of it as a ‚Äúfront desk‚Äù or a ‚Äúcustomer service representative‚Äù ‚Äî you don‚Äôt need to deal with every department inside a company; you just talk to one person who handles it for you.

üè¢ Real-world Analogy

Imagine booking a vacation:

You need to book a flight, a hotel, and a car.

Normally, you‚Äôd call three different services.

Instead, you use a TravelAgent (Facade):

You ‚Üí TravelAgent ‚Üí (FlightBooking + HotelBooking + CarRental)


The agent handles the messy coordination internally.

    this.lights.dim(30)
    this.projector.on()
    this.projector.wideScreenMode()
    this.sound.on()
    this.sound.setVolume(50)
    this.dvd.on()
    this.dvd.play(movie)
  }

  endMovie() {
    console.log("Shutting movie theater down...")
    this.lights.on()
    this.projector.off()
    this.sound.off()
    this.dvd.off()

// Client Code

const homeTheater = new HomeTheaterFacade(

  new Projector(),

  new Lights()

homeTheater.watchMovie("Inception")
